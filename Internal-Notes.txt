PROCESS NOTES

> General Git Commands
    - `git pull origin main`: Pull the Main Repo (most up to date)
    - `git checkout branch-name`: Switch to your feature branch
    - `git branch -a`: View all Branches
    - `git push origin`: Push to github

> PROCESS
* NOTE: ALL your changes should ALWAYS follow the process. NEVER push directly to main
* You should NEVER be working on the main branch
* TRY NOT to make broad tickets; break into smaller tickets

1. Create your Ticket
    - Go to 'Issues' and Create new Issue using a short but sweet title + descriptive body
    - Assign ticket to yourself if you are working on it - this will let us know who's on what
    - Once you create a ticket, under "Development" you can create a Feature Branch

2. Work on your Ticket:
    - `git pull origin main`: Pull repo fresh from main
    - `git fetch origin`: Grab your branch
    - `git checkout branch-name`: Make sure you're on your branch.

3. Commit your changes
    - TEST to make sure your changes haven't caused any issues with functionality
    - Commit your changes as you would any other time (git add, git commit -m "Descriptive but Short Message")
    - Commit often and incrementally! DO NOT PUSH YET!
    - `git pull origin main`: Every time you commit, re-pull the main repo using `git pull origin main`
    
        - IF YOU RUN INTO MERGE CONFLICTS WHEN PULLING
            - Go through the conflict and RESOLVE.
            - Recommit your changes
        - IF All looks good
            - Continue coding/committing 
    
    - `git push origin`: Once you're done with all your commits, push changes to github with `git push origin`

4. PULL REQUEST
    - Once you push your changes, go to 'Pull Request' Tab in Repo
    - Click "New Pull Request"
    - Base should be 'Main' (/shaycore) and 'Compare' should be the feature branch you pushed to
    - Add Description and Submit Request

5. REVIEW REQUESTS / APPROVE
    - DO NOT approve your own requests. (I've allowed the ability to, in case of emergencies, but this is bad practice)
    - IF THERE ARE MERGE CONFLICTS 
        - Review, Decline, and leave Notes.
        - Submitter to review, correct merge conflicts, and resubmit requests
    - IF THERE ARE NO CONFLICTS / REVIEW LOOKS good
        - Approve the Request
        - Close Ticket
        - Delete Branch
    * Feel free to PING in our slack if you need something reviewed!!


OVERALL NOTES:
- Always be pulling the main repo as you commit as this will prevent conflicts
- Keep an eye out on the tickets being worked on to not do double work
- ALWAYS make a ticket no matter how small the change you're making to the code!
